# LocalDrive

### Project Goal

The primary objective of this project is to explore and implement recent Java features, including virtual threads and records, alongside modern development and deployment practices. This includes utilizing GitHub Actions for CI/CD, Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration, integrating with third-party services, and examining concurrency in distributed systems.

### Key Concepts Studied

The following key concepts have been studied and implemented in this project:

* **Java Recent Features:**
    * **Virtual Threads:** This project leverages virtual threads to monitor local user folders and Google Drive. When a virtual thread detects a file system change (e.g., creation, modification, deletion) within a monitored folder, it processes the change and initiates synchronization with other monitored folders. This approach enhances concurrency and responsiveness by allowing the application to handle multiple file system events concurrently without blocking operating system threads.
    * **Records**: coming up next
* **CI/CD:**
    * **GitHub Actions**: coming up next
